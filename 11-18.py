## Lets Make a Simple Calculator that only does Subtraction and Addition, Using what we have learned so far

## 1) Print an introductory statement explaining the rules of the calculator (Subtraction and Addition only).
print("hey")

## 2) Ask the user whether they want to add or subtract and store their answer into memory for later use

## 3) Ask the user for their 2 numbers and store them into memory.
one = input("1")
two = input("2")
## 4) Using an if statement, perform either subtraction or addtion on the 2 numbers.
##.   and Print the output to the user.
if True:
    print(one+two)
    print(one-two)
else:
    print(one-two)
